          I've recently graduated from MIT with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Design, 
          my previous work while as a student was in the Tangible Media Group in MIT Media Lab. There 
          I worked as an undergrad researcher, then a project Assistant, working on a prototype 
          web application utilizing <a target="_blank" className={styles.link} href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>.
          My endgame is to continue my passion for art and technology in whatever opportunities arise.
